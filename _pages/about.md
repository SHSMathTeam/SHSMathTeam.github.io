Welcome! We are the Staples Math Team, a group of students competing in the Fairfield County Math League (FCML)!

Our current captains are [Tom Zhang '23](https://engitom.github.io), Ben Saxon '23, and Nikhil Kanthan '23. 

## How big is the commitment?
We understand that things get busy in high school, but we have semi-weekly meetings where we do most of our practice. 

## Is there a minimum experience level required to join?
Nope, you are welcome as long as you are interested!

## When and where is the weekly club meeting?
We meet in-person on **Tuesday and Thursday**, in **Room 3063** from **2:45 to 3:45**. 

Members are not required to come to every meeting. Feel free to drop in anytime! 

## Which topics/skills are involved?
Every high school math topic before calculus!

For example, geometry, algebra, probability, and many more...

## What kind of events will we attend?
Once a month we will compete after school either at Fairfield Prep or at Staples!

Prior to that, students can learn the strategies required in competition from personally-curated resources.

## What if I'm not good at math?
Our entire goal is to improve and challenge ourselves, so as long as you try your best, that's enough!
